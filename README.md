# Pokemon Evolution App

The main goal of this application is to allow a user to enter the name of a pokemon and the app will retrieve evolution data from the pokemonapi and display it to the user. It will accept the name of the pokemon and use that name in the request to the api then format the returned data for easy consumption by the user.
